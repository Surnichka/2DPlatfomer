                Task

THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE SO FAR

1. Create a basic map
2. Create a basic player with input , jump and attack
3. Create a basic enemy with sight radius , attack , die and move
4. When an enemy dies spawn a health potions at his place and the player 
    will be able to pick it up and heal
5. Add particles for healing effect, for moving , attacking the enviroment,
    attacking the monster, when you take damage and when you jump.
6. Add skills with cooldown timer, for now dash and basic strike.
7. Add a friendly pet which will follow you around the map and will have 
    the basic animations for move, idle and follow

THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE
1. Add a grapling hook. The hook will strike in the position the mouse cursor 
    is at. If it lands at a tile it will blast you off from the ground with a
    nice speed and into the air a little above the tile. You will be able to do
    one jump to help you choose your direction after that.

    // Hook was added but it was decided that it wont go well with the game and 
        has been removed for now

2. Make the ui for the skills better. Put them all in one frame. Make them smaller
    and find them better images, so they will feel better with the game style.

3. Design a good map. This should be left for when the game is atleast 60-70% done
    so we should know what type of map we should be making. Also if the grapling hook 
    is implemented the map should be designed really well so you can have the freedom 
    to use it around the map.

4. Add items. Boots, gloves, sword, helmet, armor.
5. Add item stash. You will have the option to equip all of the items and they will give
    you stats and unlock skills.

6. Add juice to the game. Make everything feel more alive. Add effects to the trees when 
    you pass by them, rocks, everything around you should feel more alive when you move around it.
